# ODDO-BHF-Clients 

This Microsoft Data Tools project contains the implementation of a solution allowing the prediction of opportunities and
commercial risks (sales growth, up / cross sell, sales decrease, account closing, ...) as well as
profiling, scoring and classification of ODDO BHF customers / prospects.

* The ODDO Client data is loaded from a Microsoft SQL Server, pre-processed using DataTools's Data flow tasks, and saved into 
a data warehouse.

* This repository contains all the ETL (Extract/Transfer/Load) phases.
